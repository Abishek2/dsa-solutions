### 📂 Repository Structure

The solutions are organized by topic to make them easy to navigate:

* `/Arrays-Hashing` - Problems like Two Sum, Top K Frequent, etc.
* `/Stack` - MinStack, Valid Parentheses, etc.
* `/Dynamic-Programming` - Climbing Stairs, House Robber, etc.
* `/Notes` - My personal "cheatsheets" for patterns (Sliding Window, DFS, BFS).

### 🧠 Pattern Recognition (My Notes)

I focus on **patterns** rather than memorizing code. Some key patterns I've mastered:
- **Two Pointers:** Used for sorted arrays to reduce $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$.
- **Sliding Window:** For sub-array problems.
- **Fast & Slow Pointers:** For detecting cycles in Linked Lists.
